        "#### 1. **Qualitative Data** (Categorical Data)\n",
        "Qualitative data describes qualities or characteristics. This type of data is non-numerical and often involves categories or labels. It is useful when you want to classify or describe features of an object or event.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Examples of Qualitative Data:\n",
        "- **Gender** (Male, Female, Non-binary)\n",
        "- **Colors of a car** (Red, Blue, Black)\n",
        "- **Types of cuisine** (Italian, Chinese, Mexican)\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Types of Qualitative Data:\n",
        "- **Nominal Data**: Data where categories do not have any order or ranking.\n",
        "  - **Example**: Hair color (Black, Brown, Blonde), Types of fruits (Apple, Banana, Orange)\n",
        "  \n",
        "- **Ordinal Data**: Data where the categories have a specific order or rank, but the intervals between them are not meaningful.\n",
        "  - **Example**: Customer satisfaction ratings (Very satisfied, Satisfied, Neutral, Unsatisfied), Education levels (High school, Bachelor's, Master's)\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. **Quantitative Data** (Numerical Data)\n",
        "Quantitative data involves numbers and can be measured or counted. This type of data represents quantities or amounts and is often used in mathematical calculations.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Examples of Quantitative Data:\n",
        "- **Height** (170 cm, 180 cm)\n",

        "- **Number of students in a class** (25, 30, 35)\n",

        "##### Types of Quantitative Data:\n",
        "- **Interval Data**: Numerical data where the difference between values is meaningful, but there is no true zero point.\n",
        "  - **Example**: Temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit. The difference between 20°C and 30°C is meaningful, but 0°C does not indicate a complete absence of temperature.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Ratio Data**: Similar to interval data, but with a true zero point, meaning zero indicates the complete absence of the variable being measured.\n",
        "  - **Example**: Height, weight, age, and income. A weight of 0 kg means no weight, and you can say that 20 kg is twice as heavy as 10 kg.\n",

        "### Scales of Measurement:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Nominal Scale**:\n",
        "   - **Characteristics**: Categorizes data without any order or ranking. Labels are just names.\n",
        "   - **Examples**: Types of pets (Dog, Cat, Bird), Blood types (A, B, AB, O)\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Ordinal Scale**:\n",
        "   - **Characteristics**: Categorizes data with a meaningful order or ranking, but the distances between categories are not defined.\n",
        "   - **Examples**: Movie ratings (1 star, 2 stars, 3 stars), Education levels (Diploma, Bachelor’s, Master’s)\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Interval Scale**:\n",
        "   - **Characteristics**: Measures data with equal intervals between values, but no true zero point.\n",

        "\n",
        "4. **Ratio Scale**:\n",
        "   - **Characteristics**: Contains all the properties of interval data, but with a true zero point, allowing for meaningful comparisons of ratios.\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "**Skewness** is a measure of the asymmetry or lopsidedness of the distribution of data. It describes the direction and degree to which a distribution deviates from being symmetrical (i.e., a bell curve or normal distribution). In a normal distribution, the skewness is zero because the data is perfectly symmetrical. Skewness can be positive, negative, or zero, depending on the shape of the distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Types of Skewness:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Positive Skew (Right Skew)**:\n",
        "   - **Definition**: In a positively skewed distribution, the right tail (larger values) is longer or fatter than the left tail (smaller values).\n",
        "   - **Characteristics**: The mean is greater than the median, and the data tends to have more outliers on the higher end.\n",
        "   - **Example**: Income distribution, where a few individuals earn much higher salaries than most people.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "3. **Zero Skew (Symmetrical Distribution)**:\n",
        "   - **Definition**: A distribution with zero skewness is perfectly symmetrical, meaning the left and right tails are mirror images of each other.\n",
        "   - **Characteristics**: The mean, median, and mode are all equal.\n",

        "\n",
        "### **How Skewness Affects Data Interpretation:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Central Tendency (Mean vs. Median)**:\n",
        "   - Skewness affects the relationship between the mean and the median. In a positively skewed distribution, the mean is pulled to the right, while in a negatively skewed distribution, the mean is pulled to the left.\n",
        "   - If the distribution is skewed, using the mean as a measure of central tendency might not accurately represent the data, and the median may provide a better estimate.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Outliers**:\n",
        "   - Skewness often indicates the presence of outliers. Positive skew usually means there are extreme high values, and negative skew suggests extreme low values. These outliers can disproportionately influence statistical measures such as the mean and variance.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Data Transformation**:\n",
        "   - When data is skewed, transformations (like log or square root transformations) can be applied to normalize the distribution and reduce skewness. This makes statistical techniques that assume normality (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA) more reliable.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Risk of Misleading Conclusions**:\n",
        "   - If skewness is ignored, statistical tests and models that assume normality (like linear regression) can produce misleading results. Understanding skewness helps choose the appropriate statistical methods, such as using non-parametric tests when data is highly skewed."

        "\n",
        "A **random variable** is a numerical outcome of a random phenomenon or experiment. It assigns a value to each possible outcome in a sample space. Random variables are often used in probability theory and statistics to quantify and model randomness.\n",

        "A **discrete random variable** takes on a finite or countable number of distinct values. These values typically come from counting processes, such as the number of heads in a series of coin flips or the number of cars arriving at a parking lot in an hour.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Examples**:\n",
